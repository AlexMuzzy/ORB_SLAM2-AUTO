  (PCL_POINT_CLOUD_EDITOR) does not match the name of the calling package
  (PCL).  This can lead to problems in calling code that expects
  `find_package` result variables (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain
  pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/pcl/PCLConfig.cmake:619 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
